# ML-Fruit-Image-Recognition

We build ML models for features extracted from 

### Data
The data for this project consists of two separate CVS files as train and test sets, for subcategory of fruit pictures. Each row in the files corresponds to the features of one sample (one plant image). Pre- computed attributes are extracted corresponding to each image, using the last convolutional layer of the deep convolutional neural network. 

### Used Tools
We used WEKA and Python scikit-learn library for this project.

### Results
